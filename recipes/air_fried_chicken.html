                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 bone-in chicken thighs, or 6-8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat air fryer to 400° F for 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Pat the chicken thighs dry. Rub them with the olive oil.</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, combine the seasonings: paprika, dried oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. Rub seasonings over chicken thighs.</li>
                    <li>Cook chicken in a single layer in the air fryer. (Cook in batches if needed.) Cook chicken thighs at 400° F, skin side down, in the air fryer for 12 minutes. Flip and cook on the second side for 7-12 minutes, until cooked to an internal temperature of 165° F. (If using boneless, skinless chicken thighs, there is no need to flip them. Boneless chicken thighs will take 11-15 minutes total to cook, depending on their size.)</li>
                </ol>
